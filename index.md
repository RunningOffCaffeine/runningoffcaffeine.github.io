### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I personally love the game of Blackjack. I could write functions for the first time
    that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many Aces were dealt. I truly enjoyed creating the proper checks so as not to mess up the Ace values.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was a favorite because it was fun to learn how to compare strings character by character. Learning new methods for solving problems with code is always fun for me.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, Part 2 was a favorite because it was fun to see how noise can be used to create an image. Seeing the patterns that can form in the noise was very fun.
